This directory holds a SPICE netlist with SPICE2 POLY constructs in
controlled sources as typically found in vendor models.  The circuit
is just a two-stage transimpedance amp using an AD8009,
along with some slow components (AD780 and OP177A) to set bias
points.  Vendor models are used for all active components.
Successfully running this test shows that you have successfully built
the XSpice stuff with the POLY codemodel, and that you should be able
to simulate SPICE netlists with embedded vendor models.

To run this netlist, just do the following:

[localhost]# ngspice
ngspice 1 -> source output.net
ngspice 2 -> run
ngspice 3 -> plot Vout2

(Note that when you read in the netlist, you will get a bunch of 
warnings saying stuff like:

Warning -- Level not specified on line "()"
Using level 1.

Also, ngspice will complain about:

Error on line 50 : r:u101:1 u101:40 0 1e3 tc=7e-6
         unknown parameter (tc)
Error on line 283 : .temp 0 25 50 75 100
         Warning: .TEMP card obsolete - use .options TEMP and TNOM

You can ignore all this stuff . . . .)

You should get a pop-up window showing two square pulses (the second
smaller than the first) with a little bit of overshoot on the rising
and falling edges.

This stuff was done as an adjunct to work on the gEDA project.
