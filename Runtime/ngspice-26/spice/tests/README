ngspice test and example files:
===============================

This directory is organized as a tree of subdirectories containing test files
for devices and analyses implemented in ngspice.

Some files comes from the original Spice3f5 package and others have been 
contributed by developers and users.


File Extension Convention:

.cir : Circuit file. This can be a simple circuit description or a spice2
       input file.
.out : .cir files have been run and results are recorded into this
       type of file. This is useful if want to test ngspice against
       known (hopefully correct results).        
               
REPLICATE TESTS

To replicate tests you have to launch configure without any option and
compile ngspice. In the future this will change.

TO ADD NEW TESTS

Take an existing test and adopt it to your liking.  Add the test
script and its supporting files to Makefile.am.  Use `make check' to
see your new test in action.
