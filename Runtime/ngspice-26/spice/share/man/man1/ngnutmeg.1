.SH "NAME"
ngnutmeg \- ngspice post-processor
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBngnutmeg\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIdatafile\fP ...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This man page is just a small overview.
The primary documentation of ngspice is in the \*[ngspice] User's Manual,
which is available as a pdf file.
.br
\fBngnutmeg\fP is a post processor for \*[ngspice] \- it takes
the raw output file created by \fBngspice \-r\fP
and plots the data on a graphics terminal or a workstation display.
Note that the raw output file is different from the
data that \*[ngspice] writes to the standard output.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-\fP
.br
Don't try to load the default data file ("rawspice") if no other files
are given.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP  or  \fB\*=no\-spiceinit\fP
Don't try to source the file ".spiceinit" upon startup. Normally \fBngnutmeg\fP
tries to find the file in the current directory, and if it is not found then
in the user's home directory.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP  or  \fB\*=completion\fP
Enable command completion. (defect)
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fIterm\fP  or  \fB\*=term=\fP\fIterm\fP
The program is being run on a terminal with \fBmfb\fP name \fIterm\fP.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP  or  \fB\*=help\fP
Display a verbose help on the arguments available to the program.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP  or  \fB\*=version\fP
Display a version number and copyright information of the program.
.PP
Further arguments are taken to be data files in binary or ascii format
(see \fBsconvert\fP(1)) which are loaded into ngnutmeg.
If the file
is in binary format, it may be only partially completed (useful for
examining \*[ngspice] output before the simulation is finished).
One file may contain any number of data sets from different analyses.
